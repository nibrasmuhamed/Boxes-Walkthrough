## Gaining Access 😉

- directory bruteforce
- secreat directory named in numeric form and it has four digits (found on hint (\*\*\**))
	- created a new wordlist with all four digit numbers and started bruteforce
- /island diretory found 
- not directory found in home, so bruteforced in /island
- found hint on source code
- again bruteforced /island/2100 with command reffered [[#Important commands 🔥]] -> 1
- got /green_arrow.ticket
- encrypted text got and decrypted using cybershef
- downloaded /etc/passwd using ftp (cd /etc)
- got username vigilante and slide
- steghide extract aa.jpg gave me the shado file which include password


## Maintaining Access 🥷
- ran `sudo -l`
- /usr/bin/pkexec found as SUID permission
- further enumeration, I've found we can execute command as another user 
- ran /bin/sh with sudo: reffer [[#Important commands 🔥]]-> 3


## Important commands 🔥
1. gobuster command to search a specific from dictionary
	```
	gobuster dir -u http://10.10.36.3/island/ -w /.../directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x .ticket
	```
2. directory list for medium
	```
	/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
	```
3. pkexec
	```
	sudo pkexec /bin/sh
	```

## Post Exploitation ✴️
- User flag : /home/user
- Root flag : /root/root
## Tips 💡
- use hints and make tactics
- if you got any directory check source code or cntl+A to see hided or white coloured content
- bruteforce in subdirectories
- again bruteforce on subdirectories if you're stuck
- if you got something bin which is capable to execute something, run /bin/sh
