**Notes :**




## Gaining Access 😉
- ftp was open, I got access to ftp with anonymous login and found note to jake stating that jake's password is weak
- bruteforce with hydra, /rockyou.txt: I got jake's password
- user allowed to run less with sudo rights. read /etc/shadow



## Maintaining Access 🥷
- it's possible to read root.txt with less


## Important commands 🔥
1. root with less
	```
	sudo less /etc/profile
	!/bin/sh
	```

## Post Exploitation ✴️
- User flag : /home/user
- Root flag : /root/root
## Tips 💡
- if you have something which can read with sudo permission, ofcourse you can read root.txt also
- if you found any binary with suid permission, remember gtfobin
