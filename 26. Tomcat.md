## Gaining Access üòâ
- enumeration gave me the version of tomcat
- just used opensource intelligence to find the version has vulnerabity or not
- got CVE-2020‚Äì1938
- from searchsploit, I got python code to exploit
- exploitaion result gave me a user name and password, just fuzzed it to ssh, and I got the initial shell
- got a `tryhackme.asc` file. it can be convert using `gpg2john` and cracked password 
- password got from john could use to extract `.pgp` file
- before that we have import `tryhackme.asc` [[#Important commands üî•]] 2
- this gave me merlins password



## Maintaining Access ü•∑
- after logged in as merlin, merlin can run `/usr/bin/zip` without password
- on [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/zip/) I found this
- reffer [[#Important commands üî•]] 3


## Important commands üî•
1. gpg
	```
	gpg2john something > hash
	```
2. gpg :steps will ask passwords
	```
	gpg --import tryhackme.asc
	gpg --decrypt credentials.pgp
	```
3. privilage escalation with zip
	```
	TF=$(mktemp -u)
	sudo zip $TF /etc/hosts -T -TT 'sh #'
	```
## Post Exploitation ‚ú¥Ô∏è
- User flag : /home/user
- Root flag : /root/root
## Tips üí°
- for john converter, first check shell command then search on `/usr/share/john` for python file
- gtfobins are super useful when it comes with privilege escalation
