## Gaining Access 😉
- from source code, two javascript found which is available at /js directory
- got two links from those
- got one more link `http://vulnnet.thm/index.php?referer=`, this can be used to read /etc/passwd using curl [[#Important commands 🔥]] 1
- Since we are dealing with an Apache web server, we have to find the `.htpasswd` of the `broadcast.vulnnet.thm` web server. By default, you can view web configurations in the `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf`. Run the following command to read this file:
- by reading `/etc/apache2/.htpasswd` , I got username and hashed password
- logged in to subdomain with this credeantials
- used curl command to upload phprevshell [[#Important commands 🔥]] 2
- got a revshell

## Post Exploitation ✴️
