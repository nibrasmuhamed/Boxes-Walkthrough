**Notes :**




## Gaining Access 😉
- gobuster with common.txt -> `/assets` which is a rabbithole
- in `assets` got `.css` which contains hint as comment
- turning off javascript lead to more hint which is another rabbithole
- by intercepting the request to rabbit hole, I found a hidden directory
- it was an image with png extension
- after analysing image using `strings`, I got ftp username and password lists
- used [cipher.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/brainfuck-language) to analyse text got from ftp




## Maintaining Access 🥷
- I got a message on login ssh
- located s3cr3t
- other users password written there
- further enumeration sudo and vi found vulnerable and suid perm respectively
- exploited


## Important commands 🔥
1. vi and sudo combination
	```
	sudo -u#-1 /usr/bin/vi /home/gwendoline/user.txt
	```

## Post Exploitation ✴️
- User flag : /home/user
- Root flag : /root/root
## Tips 💡
- try turning off javascript
- if you stuck on web, call burp and bruteforce possibilities
- read pressh message
