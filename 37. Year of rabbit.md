**Notes :**




## Gaining Access 😉
- gobuster with common.txt -> `/assets` which is a rabbithole
- in `assets` got `.css` which contains hint as comment
- turning off javascript lead to more hint which is another rabbithole
- by intercepting the request to rabbit hole, I found a hidden directory
- it was an image with png extension
- after analysing image using `strings`, I got ftp username and password lists
- used [cipher.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/brainfuck-language) to analyse text got from ftp
